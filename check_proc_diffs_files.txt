1. different lines numbers between 2 main files .energy-gfs-db1 and .18.212.5.40
2. some of main files have no headers depnding on the custoemr requests
3. some of the products don't have post_proc_script :)
4. the usage of post_proc_script is to do some conversion process after generating the required files, like converting file from linux type to windows type. for example in windows file type each line end with \r\n but in linux the line end with \n.
5. if u change the formatter u need to test it again with prod_build.
  - path --->  /data/gfs/v10/perllib
6. gfs_report is running within formatter and it's working in between for fetch, change and conversion (fixed decimal, sec, columns)
7. need to compare the command on pgs and gfs 
8. if there's any issue with data I mean delay in data there's 3 files running every 5 mins to synch data.
9. these file may run by crontab or as service.
 - hotl_listerner.py  --> download from rapid mq file contain data and upload it to database -> work on certain tables
 - pull_skybase_obs.pl --> take data from skybase and put them in pgs db --> working on the skybase tables
 - mde-listener.py  --> grap files from rabbit mq load official edit table
10. to check if the files had been run successfully check the message log 
11. list of 100% diffs 

I use these memory monitor tools, vmstat, top, or /pgs/eric_workspace/nmon_x86_rhel75.

Also, I look at the system log file after the system recovers.   See "grep -A 100 out_of_memory /var/log/messages-20211205"


[op@trader-dev-dis1 autodir]$ grep -rn "Diff percentage = 100%" ./*.diffs | wc -l
66
[op@trader-dev-dis1 autodir]$

[op@trader-dev-dis1 autodir]$ grep -rn "Diff percentage = 100%" ./*.diffs
./ACESHRLYNTLFCST.diffs:19:|Diff percentage = 100%
