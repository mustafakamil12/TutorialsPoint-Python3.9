issues with scripts
-------------------

1. data synchronize
2. time difference between service
3. server busy issue trigger scripts after before
4. differnce in pathe between servers.
5. need to automated the process above where now pull output of the scripts from different servers and comapare them locally.
	- need to build one to compare results with percentages of differences
6. get threshold from rob
7. need distributed system that can reachout to both systems.



required:
-------------------

1. import the class CompareProduct from a file. √
2. AutoCompare instead of Crontab. √
3. run the cycle from crontab, from the list, or from the product_update_times Or possibly from specific product list. √
4. the auto compare output a summary √
5. number of threadings: 
	cat /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max  --> 30124  √
6. run it on trader and save the output/report
7. Examine the report, identify the error patterns, fix/record them
8. fixed script errors in /pgs/bin, /pgs/lib/ or /pgs/formatter_post_proc


A. add diff /home/op/product_test/workdir/WSISJCTXT.energy-gfs-db1 /home/op/product_test/workdir/WSISJCTXT.18.212.5.40 > /home/op/product_test/workdir/WSISJCTXT.diffs to the file on top

B. header of the 2 compared files must be the same

C. # of lines

diff -y --suppress-common-lines file1.txt file2.txt | grep '^' | wc -l

count = 0
thefile = open(thefilepath, 'rb')
while 1:
    buffer = thefile.read(8192*1024)
    if not buffer: break
    count += buffer.count('\n')
thefile.close(  )



new summary:
1. period, product name , total number of lines, number of differe lines , format if differ, header if differ


to get the other products in the crontab
crontab -l | grep product_build_send | grep -v "^#" | sed -e 's/.*product//g' -e "s/>.*//g" -e 's/,/ /g'

crontab -l | grep "product_build_send -product" | grep -v "^#" | sed -e 's/.*product//g' -e "s/>.*//g" -e 's/,/ /g'

grep prod_build.py /pgs/bin/process* | sed -e 's/.*product//g'


crontab -l | grep process


head -n 3 file1.txt


diff < ( head -n 2 /home/op/product_test/workdir/NC2OBSTXT.CON.energy-gfs-db1 ) < ( head -n 2 /home/op/product_test/workdir/NC2OBSTXT.CON.18.212.5.40 )
